# Neural Network from Scratch

This project implements a basic neural network from scratch using Python and NumPy. It demonstrates key components like forward propagation, weight initialization, and basic dataset handling.

## Features
- Dense layers with customizable input and output sizes
- Forward propagation
- Dataset generation with `spiral_data` (via `nnfs` or custom implementation)
